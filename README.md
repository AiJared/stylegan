# Image Generation Model using StyleGAN

## Key Innovations in StyleGAN

1. **Mapping Network**

 - Transforms input noise to an intermediate latent space
 - Non-linear transformations prevent unwanted correlations
 - Allows for more controlled generation

2. **Synthesis Network**

 - Progressive growing of feature maps
 - Simulated Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN)
 - Noise injection for stochastic variation
